The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,a// b.The second line should contain the result of float divisio
n, a / b.No rounding or formatting is necessary.
solution:
f _name_ == '_main_':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)
